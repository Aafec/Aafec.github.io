  <p class="hadith">Sincerety and having correct intention in all Deeds and Statements, Apparent as well as Hidden.</p>
  <p class="put"> <strong> First three to enter hell (shevers the heart)</strong> <br> MUADH quares the Messenger (S.A.W): Muadh be awear on the day of judgement a Scholra, donaitor of his or her wealth and the Mujahid Fisabillah will be brought. <br> Allah (S.W.T) will say to the Scholra, i gave you knowledge. what did you do with it. The person will say my lord i taught it for your sake and he will say to him you are lying! and the angels will repeat you are lying! and he will say, you only taught it so that it will be said about you, there goes a knowledgeble Scholra, a popular man, a role model for all of us and you recived all of these beautiful words as you intended. <br> Then the donator of wealth will be brought, He will say to him i gave you wealth and what did you do with it? and he will say, i gave it in your pathway my lord. he will say you are lying! and the angels will repeat you are lying!. You only give it so that people can say what a generous man or woman he/she is and so was saied you have recived that reward. <br> Then the Mujahid Fisabillah who gave up his life! shed his blood! died on the battle field will be brought and asked, what did you do with this body? he will say i defended the weak and your religion, i fought for you my lord!. He will say you are lying! and the angels will repeat you are lying! You only fought so that people can say you are a brave man and for them to build monuments out of you, so that you may live on in glory in this world and you have recived that. The Messenger tapped Muadh on his lap very harshly causing him to give him attention. He said to him Oh Muadh do you know this are the first three with whom hell fire shall be ignited with. ALLAHU AKBAR. A Scholra whose knowledgespread throughout the world, benifitted the ummah but hell fire will be ignited with him, a person who gave his or her life will as well be ignited with hell fire and a person who gave his or her wealth will also be ignited with hell fire as well all because the intention inside is wrong. <br> Therefore, Brothers and Sisters in Islam the matter is very crusal, only Allah knows the intention and i write to you from my heart to yours for what am about to write to bring your attention to. Brothers and Sisters am not here to judge, let me make it absolutely clare that any advice i give here should not be a wepon against others nor am i giving you ammunition to go out and look at people and judge them and prais yourself. Beware Allah said in the Quran "Never praise yourself in piety he is the one who knows who is pious" and you are not the a person who goes out to judging people of their intentions, let me remine you of an incident. One of the sahabes who was fighting in the battle field and one of the enemies fel to the ground and lost his wepon and finally declear the faith, but the muslim still killed him. When the Messenger (S.A.W) found out about the matter he get upset, the sahabe said oh Messenger he only said it out of fear and the Messenger reply to him by saying "did you open up his heart to look inside?" This was in a battle field and the Messenger (S.A.W) said this, then what about us in the streets, Mosques and so on. <br> Usually when youngstars are young and stars our religion new, it enters our hearts, because we fear a lot for our families we forget that for all this years our mothers and fathers trying to set us on the straight path, then we begin to attack them and judge them wanting to change them in a night or two, to the point when we forget our character and manners towards our parents, forgeting that the intention is ment to be for Allah (S.W.T). May Allah guide us to do every act of good for the sake of Allah sincerely. Ameen Ya-Allah.</p>
  <p class="int"><b>Allah the most hight saids that all people are commanded to worship Him with sincerety, perform prayers, and give alms; and this is the correct religion(Al-Bayyina:5). [In speaking about the sacrificial animals during pilgrimage] Allah says that neither their flesh no their blood will reach Him; rather, piety of the believers will reach Him (Al-Hajj:37). He, the Most Sublime, also commands His Messenger to tell people that whether they hide what is in their bosoms or reveals it , Allah has knowledge of it (Al-Imran:29).</b>
  <p class="int"><strong>Aaishah (may Allah be please with her),</strong> relates that the prophet (SAW) said, "After the conqueas [of Macca], no Muslim is required to migrate [because Macca has become the land of Muslims from which they should not migrate]. Whoever, every Muslim is required to perform jihad (striving in the way of Allah) and to have the intention to do so. If you are asked to strive, you should do so."<strong>(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</strong></p>
 
<div class="hadith">  
<p class="q1"><b>Abu Huraira(RA)</b>relates that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said "Allah does not look at your bodies and your shapes, He looks at your hearts."<b>Muslim</b></p> 
<p class="q1">Scholras say that performance of repentance is obligatory on every person who commits an act of disobediance. Such acts are usually divided into two kinds: those that are between the person and Allah, where no right of humans are breached, and those that involve breaching of the rights of fellow humans. There are three conditions for penitence from sin of the first kind.</p>

<div class="q1">
<ol>
 <li>Leaving off the sin,</li><br>
   <li>Repenting haveing committed the sin, and</li><br>
    <li>Resolving not to go back to sin.</li>
  </ol><br>

<p>If one of these condition is not fulfilled, a person's penitence is not correct.</p>
<p>Concerning the second kind-when the sin involves breaching of the rights of fellow humans-then a fourth condition is required in addition to the three mentiion above. <br> The sinner must unburden himself from the implications of the sin: if it involves ill-begotten money or something similar, he must return it to rightful owner; if he has accused the owner of some illegal act (like adultry) or if he has caluminated against him, he should seek his forgiveness. A person furthermore, has to perform from all sins with a clear heart-felt intention; he should not be absolved from sins he has not intended to repeat. <br> Allah the most Sublime has commamded all believers to repent their sins so that they may attain success and deliverance (Al-Nur:31). In another verses Allah encourages believers to seek His forgiveness and repent from their sins (Hud:3; Al-Tahrim:8). </p>

        <p><b>Abu Sa id and Abu Huraira (RA)</b>relate that the prophet(SAW) said, "Nothing afflicts a Muslim, be it tiredness, sickness, worry, sadness, harm, distress, or even pricking of a thron, but Allahwill cross out by it some of his sins."<b>(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</b></p>
        <P><b>Abd Allah Ibn Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (RA) </b> Relates that the Messenger (S.A.W) said, "Allah (S.W.T) the Glorious and Magnificent will accept the repentance of his creature until his death gurgle starts." (A[-Tirmidhi, and he says it is a hasan hadith]) <br> <strong>Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari (RA) </strong> Relates that the Messenger said, "Allah the most Sublime streches His Hand by night so that those who have sinned during the day would repent; and He streches His Hands by day so that those that sinned by night might repeat. This will last until the sun rises from the west (at the end of time)." (Muslim) <br> <strong> Ibn Abbas (RA) </strong> Relates that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said, "if a son of Adam were to possess a valley full of gold, he would like to have two such valleys; nothing would fill his mouth but dust, and Allah will accept repentance from those who perform it." (Man would continue to be greedy until he dies.) (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) <br> <strong>Abu Huraira (RA) reports that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said,</strong>  "Allah is pleased with two men, one of whom kills the other, and both go to paradise. One of them is fighting in the way of Allah and he gets killed. Later, Allah will have mercy on the killer; he embrase Islam, and is martyed." (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) </P>
